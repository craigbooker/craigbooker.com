God Inspired Visions Lead Back to God not to us. Never Lose Sight of Your Dependence on God.

Do Not Step Out On Your Own Strength.

Be Locked Into Your Source of Strength(God).

Vision Supported By Faith

Our Faith Should Fuel Our Vision

Never Lose Sight of Who Should Get the Credit.

Visionary â€“ Committed to what could be and should be in spite of what is going on around you.
