I do not know about you, but there are times when my collective fear seems like too much to handle. When all of the normal, day-to-day activities suddenly seem overbearing. As you go about your day, you are overwhelmed to think about the simplest of things. Whether it is calling in your prescriptions or making it to that meeting in time, it suddenly seems daunting. Between getting that project done for work, preparing the meal for dinner that night, or picking up the kids, it all can seem like too much. All of a sudden, you just want to hide inside your shell hoping these feelings go away.

As we go about our life dealing with our daily fear or anxiety, there will be times when life seems like too much to handle. I want to take a minute to acknowledge the feelings and give them a little space to breathe. Often we do not allow ourselves room to feel our feelings and make sense of them.

Along your journey in life, there will be days where everything seems like too much. Whether it is Monday morning and you are struggling with the transition into your week or if it is Thursday and you still have not transitioned, I hope to give you some practical things to do when life seems like too much.

## "Check Yo Self"

Pay attention to what your body might be trying to tell you. When fear starts to seem like too much, we tend to ignore important signs our body is giving us. There's a particular saying from 1990's pop-culture which I think is especially fitting for this situation. A phrase made popular by Ice Cube in his song released in 1992 called "Check Yo Self."

"You better check yourself, before you wreck yourself." - Ice Cube

I believe that saying is particularly fitting in this scenario. Make a habit of checking yourself. Call it what you want, do it whenever you want, but the key is to do it consistantly. Look for new, unusual habits which might have crept into your life. Ask a friend or family member for their feedback. They may be able to see new habits you cannot see. Find someone you trust and ask them.

## Start Your Day Off Right

At the risk of soundy a little preachy, I am going to include this one because it is the most beneficial advice I can possibly give for anyone who is going through a battle with anxiety. If you are not already doing so, start your day off by spending time in God's Word and in prayer. I know a lot of people who choose to do this at night, I used to be one of them. Regardless, I would emplor you to spend the first part of your day focused on God. You can still have your time in the evening if you choose, but make sure to put God first in your day. This is not just important in our finances, but in our day as well. God is honored when we place him first on our agenda for the day. When I start my day off with God, it is always better than when I fail to do so.

## Pause Mid-day

If you have not noticed already, your baseline level of stress and anxiety during this time is higher. By baseline, I mean the level you get back to when you are not super relaxed or super stressed. When this is the case, it is super important to take extra measures to lower these levels. One way we can do that is by pausing mid-day to shift our focus off of our fears and onto God. This is as much for your physical health as it is for your mental health. Take a few minutes in the middle of your day to surrender to God. Stop and pray, read a short passage of scripture, whatever works best for you. The intention here is to slow down, take your focus off of you or your concerns and place your focus on God.

## Take It Easy On Yourself

If you are experiencing a greater amount of anxiety than normal, there is a good chance it relates to something new in your life. Maybe you have taken on more at work or at home, either way, give yourself a break! If your increased anxiety is due to an event, then chances are you are dealing with something unfamiliar. Allow yourself time and space to adust to whatever is new in your life.

With all of this the purpose is to make a shift. The habits and methods that got you here won't get you to where you want to be. Changing the trajectory of your mental state requires change and intentionality. Healthy habits and a change in perspective are just one way you can adjust course in your pursuit of peace and contentment. I would love to hear what has worked for you.
