# Identifying the Lies

In [God, Strengthen My Faith](https://www.craigbooker.com/blog/god-strengthen-my-faith/), we came to the realization that we might not have the faith to effectively ask God to make it all go away. We prayed asking God to strengthen our faith. When fear grips someone as much as it had a hold on me, you begin to accept lies as truth. The longer we believe in the lies, the blurrier the line between the truth and lies becomes. Essentially, the lies become our truth. As long as we believe the lies at any level, we are unable to find true freedom from our fear and anxiety.

## Danger Ahead

While I certainly do not want to scare anyone or blame everything on our Enemy, the Devil, you must be aware of the grave danger ahead. If you find yourself believing even the smallest of lies, you have set foot on the Devil's home turf. You have unknowingly opened the door to the Enemy. You are in his territory now and He is lurking, ready to pounce on even the smallest of your fears.

[1 Peter 5:8](https://my.bible.com/bible/111/1PE.5.8)<br/>
'Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. '

Be cautious not to blame everything on the Enemey, but live with an awareness that He is real and waiting to take advantage of your fear. If anxiety is interfering with your life on any level, there is a good chance you are believing lies.

## The Practical

As long as we are unaware of the lies we are believing, we will continue to be subject to them. The worst thing we can do is to claim immunity, we are not believing any lies. Take to time ask God to help identify any lies you might be believing. Be humble enough to realize you might be too close to the lies you are believing. If you really want healing from the anxiety, be couragious enough to pray Psalms 139:23-24.

[Psalms 139:23-24](https://my.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.139.23-24) <br/> 'Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.'

A second option is to ask a trusted friend if there are any lies they see us believing. Do not ask this if you are unwilling to listen.

## Today's Takeaway - Identify the Lies

Building on what we learned in [God, Strengthen My Faith](https://www.craigbooker.com/blog/god-strengthen-my-faith/), let us start again by asking God to strengthen our faith. Next we should ask God the question, what lies am I believing which set themself up against the Word of God?

1. Write down these lies as the Holy Spirit reveals them to you.
