## [Colossians‬ ‭3:12‬ ‭AMP‬‬](https://www.bible.com/bible/1588/col.3.12.amp)

**“So, as God’s own chosen people, who are holy [set apart, sanctified for His purpose] and well-beloved [by God Himself], put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience [which has the power to endure whatever injustice or unpleasantness comes, with good temper];”**
‭‭

It is important that as believers we realize Who we are and How God has called us to live. We are to be holy or “set apart.” This verse IS a huge challenge for me to live out each day, but a great daily reminder of the person I am called to be.

## Prayer:

Father, God you have called us to be holy just as you are holy (1 Peter 1:16). Give us the strength to live out Cololssians 3:12. Help us to forgive ourselves when we fail and teach us how to learn and move forward for your glory. -Amen.
