In your journey to become more like Christ, you can’t go long without truth becoming part of the conversation. Being truthful in what we say and do is not just something our parents want from kids it’s something Jesus seeks from us too.

Today we’ll address why we should seek to be honest in all we say and do.
As you read through today’s scriptures, think of how these verses apply to your life.

[Proverbs 12:22 NLT](https://bible.com/bible/116/pro.12.22.NLT)
The Lord detests lying lips, but he delights in those who tell the truth.

[Proverbs 6:16‭-‬19 NLT](https://bible.com/bible/116/pro.6.16-19.NLT)
There are six things the Lord hates— no, seven things he detests: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that kill the innocent, a heart that plots evil, feet that race to do wrong, a false witness who pours out lies, a person who sows discord in a family.

If we are following after Christ, we are seeking to be more and more like Him. We have shifted from seeking to please ourselves to seeking to please Christ. Both verses listed here make it clear that telling the truth is incredibly important to God. Pleasing Christ means we must seek to be truthful in all we say and do. Let us seek to be truthful because of our love for Christ.

Prayer: God we want so deeply to please you. We want to show you how much we love you. Help us to be truthful in our actions and in our words. -Amen.
