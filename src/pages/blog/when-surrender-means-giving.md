  - What Does It Mean To Surrender
---

I believe that surrender takes shape in several different ways. One thing is certain, if you follow Jesus long enough, one of the ways God will ultimately call you to surrender is through giving. Giving is not just something God does, it is a part of His character. Giving(generous) is who He is. By responding to God’s prompts to give, we show God we trust Him and we want to be more like Him. As we begin seeing the world through God’s lens of generosity, we will discover opportunities to give of our time, talent, and resources.

## Time

Time is our most valuable resource. It is limited and we cannot create more of it. Once it is given away it is gone forever. This is perhaps one of the areas which we tend to mismanage the most. We try to save it all up for ourselves only to spend it on all the wrong things. We realize its importance, yet we continually neglect properly stewarding our time. If we are willing to listen, God will call us to give of our time to the Church and to others. How we spend our time is often a good reflection of where our heart is at. Do we look for opportunity to share of our time or do we hoard it all only to spend it on endless Netflix binges?

“Because you trusted me, I will give you your life as a reward. I will rescue you and keep you safe. I, the Lord, have spoken!"
‭‭Jeremiah‬ ‭39:18‬ ‭NLT‬‬

## Talent

Talent is often closely linked with our time. So when we give of our time, we often are utilizing our talent. Our talent is an area we cannot claim credit for, but often fills us with a deep sense of pride. It is as if we are saying we had something to do with forming it. Giving of our talent is a form of gratitude which sets us up with a proper Kingdom view. If we are not using our talent to serve in God’s Kingdom, then there is a need which is going unmet. Find a place in God’s Kingdom to offer your talent, and plug in. You’ll never be the same again.

“If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake and for the sake of the Good News, you will save it.”
‭‭Mark‬ ‭8:35‬ ‭NLT‬‬

## Resources

For most, when they think about resources their minds immediately think about money, but this is not always the case. Certainly, resources can be things one owns such as a house, financial investments such as stock or a 401K. But sometimes a resource can be a relationship, or a connection. Sometimes resources might be an old car you are no longer using. Resources can vary from one person to the next, but one thing is sure. If you are open to hearing God’s voice, He will call you to use your resources to meet a need of someone in your path.

Using the resources God has entrusted to you is one way of surrendering your will to God’s will.

## Don’t Miss Out!

While these areas are just some of the many ways God might call one to give, this is where it starts. Ultimately, we choose who we will follow and serve, ourselves or God. In choosing to follow Jesus, we have the opportunity to enter into a rich, and full-life He died to offer to us as His children. So no more FOMO(Fear of Missing Out). Seek God’s guidance. And when the Holy Spirit prompts you to give instead of responding with “say what?”, step into the full-life which is waiting for you.
