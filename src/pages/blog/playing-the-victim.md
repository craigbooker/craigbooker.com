We’ve all been there before. Someone we know makes a mistake large or small and the first thing they say is “It isn’t my fault **\_\_** made me do it.” We all know someone who refuses to own up to their own responsibilities and actions. When under pressure for something done wrong, many times it is easier to shift the blame to someone or something else. Often it is to take the focus off of the individual and onto something or someone else. The desire to escape the blame or to escape the consequences is one that crosses the mind of all humans at one point or another. It’s the fight or flight response. Will the individual own up to their actions (fight) or try to shift the blame or focus to someone else (flight). Character plays a large role in this as does fear.

When tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed.
[James 1:13-14](http://bible.us/Jas1.13.NIV84)
