**Please Note**<br/>
_Please note that I AM NOT a counselor nor am I a physician, so please take this information for what it is. This is a part of my story and what I have learned about anxiety. I hope it is helpful, but it is not a substitute for getting the help you need._



<br/>

We are all facing a world with new realities as COVID19 reaks havoc on the lives of those we hold most dear. As these new realities begin to settle in, I have observed unparrallel levels of fear and anxiety just about every direction I turn. While I am no expert, I believe that much of what is so new to many is something similar to which I have been dealing with for many years. While this is still very traumatic for me personally, my hope and prayer is that by sharing what I have learned I might bring some perspective to the reality everyone is experiencing today.


## The Case For Building Awareness and Understanding

What I have seen from years of fighting anxiety is that effectively battling anxiety is a mutli-layered approach. We do not find longterm success by simply masking the symptoms. I personally experienced the results of this approach for twelve years. What I learned is that proper treatment is more than merely alleviating symptoms. Proper treatment includes building awareness and understanding in order to make true progress. Often, masking the syptoms is needed to get to a place where one can find the root cause of their anxiety. Once an individual discovers the root of their anxiety, they can begin taking steps towards addressing the trauma and lies which lead them down this path in the first place.

## Understanding Anxiety's Progression

From a high-level perspective, anxiety often occurs when we take our focus off of God and place it on our situation. For a non-believer this would occur when they take their focus off of their current truth and start to focus on their situation. As believers, we begin to feel the grip of anxiety when we lose sight of who God is and who we are in relation to God. In most cases, we often do so without even realizing this is happening.

As anxiety begins to pile on top of more anxiety, we often lose our footing, spiraling out of control. As the level of anxiety mounts, we become less and less capable of pulling ourselves out of this downward spiral on our own. Reality becomes less and less a part of the conversation as we bow to our worst fears.

## Living By A New Playbook

As we begin to look at life through the lens of our worst fears, our reality takes a dramatic shift. Now, nothing we do is the same as it was before. Everything is seen through this new playbook. Everything is framed through a lens distraught with fear or how to avoid that which causes anxiety.

What I hope to do here is to provide you with the tools I did not have going through this the first time around. Understandably, this won't work for everyone, but my hope is that it might help one. If I can help one person through the Hell of anxiety, my pain will have served a great purpose not only for me, but for someone else. If you are experiencing anxiety, I beg you to enlist the help of friends, family, and a counselor. Do NOT brush it off as "nothing" and pretend you are strong enough to handle this alone. The results of doing so can cost you and the ones you love dearly.
