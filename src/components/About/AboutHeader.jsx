						I'm a Writer and Software Developer from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. I
						started tinkering with electronics when I was young. I first learned
						about repairing Apple(iOS) devices when I worked for Apple retail.
						It was at Apple retail I received my certification to work on what
						Apple calls small device repair. At that time this included iPhones,
						iPads, and iPods.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also learned Appleâ€™s methods in training individuals to get the
						most out of their products. I aim to take what I learned at Apple
						and combine the best customer service, my love for great apps and my
						dedication to my customers to provide the best products. It is at
						the intersection of these three areas where I shine the best.
