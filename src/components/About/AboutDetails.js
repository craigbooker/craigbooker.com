          <p>
            I'm a Writer and Software Developer from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. I started tinkering with electronics when I was young. I first learned about repairing Apple(iOS) devices when I worked for Apple retail. It was at Apple retail I received my certification to work on what Apple calls small device repair. At that time this included iPhones, iPads, and iPods.
          </p>
          <p>I also learned Appleâ€™s methods in training individuals to get the most out of their products. I aim to take what I learned at Apple and combine the best customer service, my love for great apps and my dedication to my customers to provide the best products. It is at the intersection of these three areas where I shine the best.</p>
